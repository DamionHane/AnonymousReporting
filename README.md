# Anonymous Reporting System üõ°Ô∏è

A blockchain-based privacy-protected reporting platform built with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling secure and anonymous whistleblowing.

## üåü Overview

The Anonymous Reporting System is a decentralized application that allows users to submit confidential reports about various violations while maintaining complete privacy. Built on blockchain technology with advanced FHE encryption, this platform ensures that sensitive information remains protected throughout the entire reporting and investigation process.

**Live Demo**: [https://anonymous-reporting.vercel.app/](https://anonymous-reporting.vercel.app/)

**Repository**: [https://github.com/DamionHane/AnonymousReporting](https://github.com/DamionHane/AnonymousReporting)

## üéØ Core Concept

### Privacy-First Whistleblowing with FHE Technology

Traditional reporting systems often expose the identity of reporters, creating risks of retaliation and discouraging people from coming forward. Our system solves this fundamental problem by leveraging:

- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**: All sensitive data is encrypted on-chain, allowing computations on encrypted data without revealing the underlying information
- **Blockchain Transparency**: All actions are recorded immutably while maintaining privacy
- **Decentralized Governance**: No single authority controls the system, ensuring fairness and preventing censorship

### How It Works

1. **Anonymous Submission**: Users submit reports with optional anonymity. Report details are encrypted using FHE before being stored on-chain
2. **Secure Storage**: Encrypted reports are stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering
3. **Authorized Investigation**: Only authorized investigators can process reports, updating statuses and adding notes
4. **Transparent Tracking**: Anyone can track report status using the report ID, maintaining transparency without compromising privacy
5. **Statistical Dashboard**: System-wide statistics provide insights into reporting patterns and resolution rates

## üîê Key Features

### For Reporters

- **Complete Anonymity**: Submit reports without revealing your identity
- **Multiple Categories**: Report various types of violations including corruption, fraud, environmental issues, safety concerns, and discrimination
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your report status using a unique report ID
- **Privacy Protection**: All sensitive information is encrypted with FHE technology

### For Investigators

- **Report Management**: Update report statuses and assign investigators
- **Investigation Notes**: Add encrypted notes to document the investigation process
- **Investigator Access Control**: Only authorized investigators can access and process reports
- **Workflow Management**: Change report status through investigation lifecycle (Submitted ‚Üí Under Investigation ‚Üí Resolved/Dismissed)

### For Administrators

- **Investigator Management**: Add or remove authorized investigators
- **System Oversight**: Monitor overall system statistics and performance
- **Access Control**: Manage permissions and ensure only qualified personnel can investigate reports

## üìä System Statistics

The platform provides real-time statistics including:

- Total number of reports submitted
- Number of resolved cases
- Pending investigations
- Overall success/resolution rate

## üîó Smart Contract

**Contract Address**: `0xF75CEB2cE1CFb4c8493c8aa9176a833973C428a6`

The smart contract handles all core functionality including:

- Report submission with FHE encryption
- Status management and workflow
- Investigator authorization
- Event emission for transparency

### Main Functions

```solidity
// Report submission
submitAnonymousReport(uint8 _category, bool _isAnonymous)

// Investigation management
updateReportStatus(uint32 _reportId, uint8 _newStatus)
addInvestigationNotes(uint32 _reportId, string _notes)
assignInvestigator(uint32 _reportId, address _investigator)

// Access control
addInvestigator(address _investigator)
removeInvestigator(address _investigator)

// Query functions
getReportBasicInfo(uint32 _reportId)
getSystemStats()
isAuthorizedInvestigator(address _user)
```

## üìã Report Categories

The system supports the following report categories:

1. **Corruption** - Bribery, embezzlement, abuse of power
2. **Fraud** - Financial fraud, identity theft, scams
3. **Environmental** - Pollution, illegal dumping, environmental violations
4. **Safety** - Workplace safety, public safety concerns
5. **Discrimination** - Unfair treatment based on protected characteristics
6. **Other** - Any other violations not covered above

## üîÑ Report Status Lifecycle

Reports progress through the following states:

1. **Submitted** (0) - Initial state when report is filed
2. **Under Investigation** (1) - Assigned to an investigator and being reviewed
3. **Resolved** (2) - Investigation completed and issue addressed
4. **Dismissed** (3) - Determined to be invalid or unfounded

## üåê Network Requirements

To use the Anonymous Reporting System, you need:

- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Connection to the appropriate blockchain network
- Small amount of native cryptocurrency for transaction fees
